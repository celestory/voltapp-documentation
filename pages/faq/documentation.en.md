To privately document your project (for yourself and shared individuals), you can use the project's Help page (accessible from the '?' symbol at the top right of the editor).

The project's Help page can be edited by clicking on the main parent node, which gives its name to the app, at the top of the left node hierarchy. Then open the right node inspector to access the Template component. Click on 'Open Editor' to integrate titles, paragraphs, videos, links, and instructions for elements to search for (using clear node names, variables, etc.) to present the organization of your project.

In graph mode, you can create comments and block groups by right-clicking (especially to explain the logic of the graph) for easy reference based on the instructions provided on the project's Help page.
