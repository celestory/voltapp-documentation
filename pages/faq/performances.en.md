For your app project, the fewer blocks you use, the lighter your app will be. The fewer variables you have, the more you avoid errors (the Analyzer will indicate unused ones).

For example, don't hesitate to use section nodes with device states instead of the Screen Orientation node, which would require duplicating the number of nodes.
