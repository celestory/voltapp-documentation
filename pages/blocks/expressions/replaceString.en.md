This block allow you to replace some text by another one.

Let's say you want to replace `cats` by `dogs` in the text `I love cats`.

- **text** represents the text in which the replacement will occur (`I love cats`)
- **old text** represents the part of the text you want to replace (`cats`)
- **new text** represents the replacement text (`dogs`)
- **replace all** if true, replace all occurences of old text, otherwise just the first one

`result` contain the text after the replacement occured (here `I love dogs`).
