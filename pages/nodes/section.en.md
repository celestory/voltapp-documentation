The Section node is probably the one you will use the most in Voltapp. It allows you to define how to place different nodes in relation to each other by combining multiple nodes into a tree structure. The idea of a Section node is to define how to place its children nodes in relation to each other. Rather than giving a hard size, the idea is to provide a set of constraints that allow the nodes to best fit into the available space.
