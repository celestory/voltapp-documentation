This action allows you to call stored functions directly from your Supabase project.

When using the "rpc" action, you need to specify the name of the stored function you want to call, along with the required parameters for that function. Stored functions are pre-defined server-side procedures that perform specific operations on the database data.

The "rpc" action sends a request to the Supabase server to execute the stored function with the provided parameters. The stored function can perform various operations, such as calculations, data updates, validations, and more. Once the function is executed, you can receive a response from the server containing the results or data generated by the function.

Using the "rpc" action can be useful when you need to perform complex or customized operations on the data in your Supabase project, leveraging the logic defined in the stored functions.
