This action allows you to update multiple rows in a specific table of your Supabase project.

When using the "updateRows" action, you need to specify the name of the table where the rows you want to update are located, along with the selection criteria to determine which rows to update. You also need to provide the new values for the corresponding columns in those rows.

The "updateRows" action sends a request to the Supabase server to update the specified rows with the provided new values. The values you specify for the columns will be associated with their corresponding columns in the table's structure.
