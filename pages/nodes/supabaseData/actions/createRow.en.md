This action allows you to create a new row in a specific table of your Supabase project.

When using the "createRow" action, you must specify the name of the table in which you want to create the new row, as well as the values of the columns corresponding to this row.

The "createRow" action sends a request to the Supabase server to insert the new row into the specified table. The column values you provide will be associated with their corresponding values in the table structure.
