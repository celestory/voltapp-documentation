This node is a fully customisable button. It's very similar to the node **Text** but looks more like a button.

![preview](/images/button/preview.gif)

You can add an event in the button graph to do stuff when you button is clicked for example:

![graph](/images/button/graph-en.png)

You can also customize the appearance using the button states, on **hover** for example:

![hover](/images/button/hover-en.gif)
