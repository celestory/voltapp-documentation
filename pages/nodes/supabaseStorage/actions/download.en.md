This action allows you to download a file from the Supabase storage system.

When using the "download" action, you need to specify the file path of the file you want to download. The file path represents the location of the file within the storage system.

The "download" action retrieves the file from the Supabase server and transfers it to the client, enabling the user to download the file locally onto their device. The action returns a response containing the downloaded file, typically in the form of a data stream or a binary file.
