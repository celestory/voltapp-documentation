This action allows you to delete an existing bucket within the Supabase storage system. A bucket is a file container that can be seen as a folder or directory where you organize and store your files.

When using the "deleteBucket" action, you need to specify the name of the bucket you want to delete. Make sure to provide the exact name of the bucket you wish to erase, as this action is irreversible and will permanently delete all files and subdirectories contained within the bucket.

It is important to note that only empty buckets can be deleted. If a bucket contains files or subdirectories, you need to remove them first before being able to delete the bucket itself.
