This action allows you to empty an existing bucket within the Supabase storage system. A bucket is a file container that can be seen as a folder or directory where you organize and store your files.

When using the "emptyBucket" action, you need to specify the name of the bucket you want to empty. This action will permanently delete all files and subdirectories contained within the bucket, leaving the bucket empty but still existing.

It is important to note that this action is irreversible, and the deleted data cannot be recovered. Therefore, make sure to have backed up any important files before emptying a bucket.
