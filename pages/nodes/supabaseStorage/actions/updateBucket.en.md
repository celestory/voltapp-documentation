This action allows you to update the metadata of an existing bucket in the Supabase storage system.

When using the "updateBucket" action, you need to specify the name of the bucket you want to update, as well as the new metadata you want to apply.

The metadata of a bucket can include information such as the bucket name, description, access permissions, security settings, or other properties specific to your application.
