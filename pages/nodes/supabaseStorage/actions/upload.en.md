This action allows you to upload a file to the Supabase storage system.

When using the "upload" action, you need to specify the destination path for the file and provide the file you want to upload. The destination path represents the location where you want to save the file in the storage system.

The "upload" action transfers the file from the client to the Supabase server, where it is stored in the specified bucket. The action returns a response indicating that the upload was successful, along with metadata associated with the uploaded file, such as the file name, size, content type, and more.
